# Machine Learning Specialization 

This repo contains all my code for "Practice Lab" for this specialization https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction

## Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification 
  • Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
  • Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression
 
## Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
  • Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
  • Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
  • Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

## Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
  • Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
  • Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
  • Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
